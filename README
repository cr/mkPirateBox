# mkPirateBox v0.2-4
# IPKG that installs PirateBox to your fresh OpenWRT router
# (C) 2011, Christiane Ruetten, cr@23bit.net
#
# Released under GPLv2, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html

FEATURES:
  - Install this IPKG on your fresh OpenWRT "Backfire", and out
    comes (hopefully) a ready-to-use PirateBox, a project by NYU
    Professor David Darts.
  - Now supports devices with 4 MByte flash
  - See https://github.com/cr/mkPirateBox/wiki for current
    router support status.

TODO:
  - Test other platforms
  - Improve error checking

PLEASE HELP:
  - I expect mkPirateBox v0.2+ to run on many or even most untested
    router models. If something goes wrong, I usually can easily make
    it work if you help me out. If you decide to try mkPirateBox on
    an untested router model, please send send me feedback on how it
    went, including
    - your router model
    - output of the command
      "cat /etc/openwrt_release /etc/config/wireless /etc/config/network".
  - Thanks! :)
